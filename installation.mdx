# Installation

You can install bun_nltk using your preferred JavaScript package manager. The package ships with prebuilt native binaries for supported platforms and a WASM runtime for universal compatibility.

## Install with package managers

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install bun_nltk
```

```bash bun
bun add bun_nltk
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add bun_nltk
```

</CodeGroup>

## Platform support

bun_nltk provides optimized builds for different platforms:

### Native binaries (fastest)

Prebuilt native binaries are included for:

- **Linux x64**: `native/prebuilt/linux-x64/bun_nltk.so`
- **Windows x64**: `native/prebuilt/win32-x64/bun_nltk.dll`

The library automatically detects your platform and loads the appropriate native binary for maximum performance.

<Note>
Native binaries provide the best performance, typically 3-10x faster than WASM on most operations.
</Note>

### WASM runtime (universal)

For platforms without native binaries, bun_nltk includes a WebAssembly build:

- **All platforms**: `native/bun_nltk.wasm`

The WASM runtime provides:
- Universal compatibility across all platforms and runtimes
- Browser environment support
- Fallback for unsupported architectures (macOS, ARM, etc.)
- Still faster than pure JavaScript implementations

<Info>
You can explicitly use the WASM runtime by importing from the `WasmNltk` wrapper class, even on platforms with native binaries.
</Info>

## Verify installation

After installation, verify that bun_nltk is working correctly:

```typescript
import { tokenizeAsciiNative, countTokensAscii } from "bun_nltk";

const text = "Hello world! This is a test.";
const tokens = tokenizeAsciiNative(text);
const count = countTokensAscii(text);

console.log(`Tokens: ${tokens.join(", ")}`);
console.log(`Count: ${count}`);
// Output:
// Tokens: hello, world, this, is, a, test
// Count: 6
```

<Tip>
No build steps or lifecycle scripts are required - bun_nltk works immediately after installation.
</Tip>

## Environment variables

For advanced use cases, you can customize the native library path:

```bash
export BUN_NLTK_NATIVE_LIB=/path/to/custom/bun_nltk.so
```

This is useful for:
- Local development with custom builds
- Testing new native implementations
- Deployment environments with specific binary requirements

## Troubleshooting

### Platform not supported

If you see an error about missing native libraries:

```
native library not found for platform=darwin arch=arm64
Supported prebuilt targets: linux-x64, win32-x64
```

You have two options:

1. **Use the WASM runtime** (recommended):

```typescript
import { WasmNltk } from "bun_nltk";

const wasm = new WasmNltk();
await wasm.init();

const tokens = wasm.tokenizeAscii("Hello world!");
```

2. **Build from source** (advanced):

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Seyamalam/bun_nltk.git
cd bun_nltk

# Build native library
bun run build:zig

# Build WASM
bun run build:wasm
```

### Import errors

If you encounter TypeScript import errors, ensure your `tsconfig.json` includes:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "types": ["bun-types"]
  }
}
```
